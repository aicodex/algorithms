We need a way to describe sets A, B, C, D ... 
such that if the description of any two sets
are equal, we can know how similar the sets are 
to each other.

                             |A ∩ B|
P(min(H(A)) = min(H(B)) ) = -------
                             |A ∪ B|


- Let x be a member in (A union B)
- What's the probability that x is in both A and B?
- Turns out that this probablity is equal to the jaccard coeeff which can be used to measure
  similarity between two sets.
- Let H() be a hashing function
- H(A) = [ h(x) for x in A ]
- min(H(A)) = min(H(B)) if and only if the x producing the minimum hash is in A and B
- the probability that x is in both A and B is the jaccard coeff
- we compute many minhashes for a set
- to estimate similaryt of sets, we can:
    1) summarize sets as vectors of minhashes
    2) test for equality of each vector component at query time to get similarity
